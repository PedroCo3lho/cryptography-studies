# Cryptography Studies

Welcome to **cryptography-studies** â€” a collection of my personal notes, study materials, and demo projects related to cryptography, privacy, and internet protocols.

## About

This repository serves as:

- A record of my cryptographic studies and hands-on experiments.
- A collection of demo projects exploring cutting-edge cryptographic algorithms.
- A Rust training ground for practical implementations.

## Topics Covered

The main areas of focus include:

- Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)
- Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)
- TLSNotary
- Internet communication protocols
- Modern cryptographic primitives and applications

## Purpose

The goal of this repo is to consolidate my learning journey while building practical projects that deepen my understanding of cryptographic systems and protocols, while also improving my Rust skills.
